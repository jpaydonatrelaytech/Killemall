# Killemall PRONOUNCED "Kill Em All"
Have users on your machine that you aren't familiar with?  Use this PowerShell script to delete all unauthorized users on your machine.
Simply run PowerShell as an admin, copy and paste the code, fill in the users and your PC in the proper fields, and run the command, it's that simple!
First things first, to find out who is on your machine click on any file or folder, click on the security tab, then the advanced tab.
Hopefully you don't have any suspicious users who have permission entries, but to get an entire list:
Click on auditing.
Click the add button.
Selected a Principal.
Then click on advanced again. 
Then, as easy as it sounds, click on "Find Now" and below in the search results you will find all access permissions for this particular file or folder.  
There will be plenty of safe ones, but some that aren't, you'll have to go through the list individually to determine who's a "good guy" and who may be malicious.
